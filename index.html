                      <p class="card-text">JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page.JavaScript code can be embedded inline into an HTML document by using the dedicated HTML . This HTML  wraps around the JS code. The  tag can be placed either in the  section of  in the  section. The placement entirely depends on when you want the JS code to load.dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.Generally, it takes around six to 12 weeks to learn the basics of JavaScript. This includes understanding its syntax, data types, operators, and programming concepts. Becoming an expert in the language often requires two to four years of experience.With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers.

                              <p class="card-text"> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript)."Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements".
                                Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g. registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links.Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.
                                Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.

                      <p class="card-text"> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser.

                        The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.
                        
                        CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.
                        
                        A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background:"Cascading" refers to the rules that govern how selectors are prioritized to change a page's appearance. This is a very important feature, since a complex website can have thousands of CSS rules.

                        A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.

                    But if you keep the purpose of a portfolio website in mind, the path to the finish line is a clearly guided process. A portfolio website lets you show off all of your work in one place. This not only looks good to a client, but it can also help inspire you on your next projects.Your portfolio is the only web-space where everything is up to you. You are able to create a never-seen-before platform with unique content and achieve a recognizable identity the way you imagine it. A private portfolio website lets your inner creator go far beyond any cliché.</p>

To highlight your portfolio in another light, consider to include other key elements that will boost your portfolio’s user experience: case studies, testimonials, blog, and even a project you’re currently working on at the moment. </p>
